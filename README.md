# Village Simulator
A civilization simulator with a focus on person to person
interactions and personality archetypes. Heavily inspired
from the history generation system Dwarf Fortress.


# How to use this
After running press any key to simulate a day. Events will
happen at random, from villagers meeting and talking to 
bar brawls. Playing around with variables in configGlobals.py
can create drastically different outcomes for the village.
